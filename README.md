# Arch-Configs
#### This is where I store all of the configurations I need to set up a clean Arch or Manjaro install.
I choose to use zsh, so I include my .zshrc file.  
Alacritty is my terminal of choice, so I include the config file for that as well.  
Finally, I use yaourt to install packages for the AUR and include a list of the various packages that I need installed.
