# Arch-Configs
## Overview
This is where I store the various dot files that I use on my Linux system.

### ZSH
Personally, I like using ZSH as my default Shell. Included is my `.zshrc` file, which contains all of the various aliases and functions that I use.
To use my `.zshrc` file, simply copy it to your home directory and rename it to `.zshrc`.

### Neovim
I use Neovim as my default text editor. Included is my `init.vim` file, which contains all of the various plugins and settings that I use.
To use my `init.vim` file, simply copy it to your home directory and rename it to `.config/nvim/init.vim`.
